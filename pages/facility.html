                CRUISE SHIP GALLEY
            </h4>
            <p>The centerpiece of the entire facility is the well-equipped glass-walled kitchen which replicates, as closely as practicable, the equipment used on cruise ships. As a training and assessment galley, various international cruise and land base companies had used this kitchen to test the cooking skills of chef applicants and to train newly hired chefs before joining the ships. Its glass walls had also witnessed students and industry practitioners who successfully passed competency assessments in catering, cookery and bread and pastry.</p>
